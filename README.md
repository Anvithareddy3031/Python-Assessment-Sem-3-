Unit Converter
In everyday applications such as education, engineering, health, logistics, and travel, users often need to convert values between different measurement systems. Performing these conversions manually is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when switching between metric and imperial units.

The objective of this project is to design and develop a web-based unit converter that allows users to accurately convert commonly used units such as kilometers to miles and kilograms to pounds through a simple and user-friendly interface. The system should provide instant results and maintain a temporary history of conversions for the current user session.
